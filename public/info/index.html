     </header>
     <p class="description">
      Start by creating a challenge: that cconsists in a specific exercise and a daily rep target for that exercise. Next you perform that challenge on a daily basis and improve on performance. You will then get a new challenge report once a few days so you can check on your strength and endurance gains.

     <p class="description">
      Pretty much. Calisthenics is a school of functional training that uses mostly bodyweight exercises, same as this app. Most of the exercises we provide will be found in calisthenics programs and lore. However, we have added a few postural exercises that help strengthen some fundamental areas and keep you injury free.

      </header>
      <p class="description">
        Strength training is pretty much for everyone outside life-threatening conditions. That said, if you are unsure, consult with your physician before training.

          <span class="title">How is weight calculated?</span><i class="fa-solid fa-plus"></i>
        </header>
        <p class="description">
          In your wokrout screen, you will see in the bottom right two sections: <i>weight</i> and <i>volume</i>. Weight is the bodyweight distribution of that particular exercise, and volume is the total resistence of your workout. However, the bodyweight load distribution for each exercises is an estimate, and relies on form, body structure and other factors in order to be exact; which is why in our performance reports we do not focus on volume in absolute numbers, but rather on volume variation and trends.</p>

        <span class="title">Will this training style build muscle?</span><i class="fa-solid fa-plus"></i>
      </header>
      <p class="description">
        Since resistance is limited by your own bodyweight, this app chalenges for volume, which will lead to higher gains in strength and endurance, rather than hypertrophy. Hypertrophy does take place as well though, and can result in mass increase. However changes in bodymass depend on multiple factors such as nutrition, sleep, lifestyle etc.

        <span class="title">How do you measure performance?</span><i class="fa-solid fa-plus"></i>
      </header>
      <p class="description">
        We measure a number of variables such as the number of reps per each set, the rested set output, volume trends, workout duration and more.
